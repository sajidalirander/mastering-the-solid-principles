## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both must depend on abstractions. 
> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. 

## __without DIP__
```python
class ConfigLoader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parser = YamlConfigParser()  # tightly bound to YAML

    def load(self, path):
        return self.parser.read_yaml(path)
```
It is an example of tight coupling. Disadvantages are:
* Tightly coupled to `YamlConfigParser`.
* If later want to support JSON, TOML, etc., it must be modified.

This is __inversion gone wrong__ â€” the high-level logic (`ConfigLoader`) depends directly on low-level details (`YamlConfigParser`).


## __with DIP__
DIP suggests flip the dependencies:
* `ConfigLoader` should depend on an abstract interface like `ConfigReader`
* Then inject the concrete parser (e.g., `YamlConfigParser`) from the outside
