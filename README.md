# Mastering the SOLID Principles

Writing understandable, maintainable, and flexible code

## Overview

| Principle | Name | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|   S  |  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)    |   A class should have only one reason to change.   |
|   O  |  Open/Closed Principle (OCP)   |   Entities open for extension, but closed for modification.   |
|   L  |  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)   |   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.   |
|   I  |  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)    |  Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.    |
|   D  |  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)    |  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.    |


## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
> Every class should focus on doing only one thing.

A practical example is implemented. Interested users can [click here](./s_principle/) to review the material and get hands-on to the principle. 

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
> Open for extension but closed for modification. 

In other words, able to add new features without changing old code. An [example](./o_principle/) is provided to compare the effect of using `o-principle` and without using it.
